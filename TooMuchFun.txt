What makes programming enjoyabe is the challenge, the work, seeing the end results. You work toward and end goal and seeing the results displayed. No two programs will be the same either, which makes that much more enjoyable. The whole concept of the programming is enjoyable to me. From the start of the planning of the program to the final implemtation and handing it off to the people that wanted it coded.
